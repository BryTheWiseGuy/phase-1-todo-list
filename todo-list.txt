I am editing this text document to illustrate git workflow

To-Do List for this project:

1. Create a new directory called todos to contain a new project. (mkdir)
2. Navigate into the new directory. (cd)
3. Initialize the new directory as a Git repo. (git init)
4. Create a new file inside the folder called todo-list.txt. You can either do this from the terminal or in your text editor. (touch)
5. Stage your changes using the add command, then commit them with the commit message initial commit. (git add + git commit -m)
6. Open the todo-list.txt file in your text editor, and add a title and a few todo's of your choosing. (code .)
7. Return to the terminal, then add and commit your changes with the commit message added todos.
